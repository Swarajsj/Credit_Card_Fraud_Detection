# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

 	In this proposed project we designed a protocol or a model to detect the fraud activity in credit card transactions. 
  This system is capable of providing most of the essential features required to detect fraudulent and legitimate transactions. 
  As technology changes, it becomes difficult to track the Modeling and pattern of fraudulent transactions.
  With the rise of machine learning, artificial intelligence and other relevant fields of information technology, 
  it becomes feasible to automate this process and to save some of the intensive amount of labour that is put into detecting credit card fraud.
  
  Using Machine Leaning models like:
  * K - Nearest Neighbour
  * Naive Bayer's Algorithm
  * Decision Tree
  * Nueral Network
    * Single Nueral Networl
    * Multiple Nueral Network
